# 🤝 Collaborative AI Telegram Bot

A sophisticated Telegram bot that enables multiple AI agents to work together on projects through intelligent collaboration and coordination.

## 🌟 Features

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Role-based AI agents**: Each AI has a specific role (General Assistant, Code Assistant, Creative Writer, Research Assistant, Specialist)
- **Intelligent coordination**: AIs work together, building upon each other's contributions
- **Context awareness**: Maintains conversation history and project context across sessions
- **Parallel processing**: Independent tasks run simultaneously for faster results

### Project Management
- **Project-based organization**: Create and manage multiple collaborative projects
- **Persistent storage**: Projects and conversations are saved and can be resumed
- **Task tracking**: Monitor progress with tasks and milestones
- **Statistics**: Track collaboration metrics and agent contributions

### Advanced Workflows
- **Dependency management**: Tasks can depend on other tasks for proper sequencing
- **Synthesis engine**: Combines multiple AI perspectives into coherent responses
- **Confidence scoring**: Track how confident each AI is in their contributions
- **Flexible architecture**: Easy to add new AI agents and collaboration patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Telegram Bot Token
- API keys for AI services (OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, xAI)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-collaboration-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   export BOT_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token"
   export WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-domain.com/webhook"
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_key"
   export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_deepseek_key"
   export XAI_API_KEY="your_xai_key"
   ```

4. **Run the bot**
   ```bash

   ```

## 📋 Usage

### Creating a Collaborative Project

1. **Start the bot**: Send `/start` to your bot
2. **Create project**: Click "🆕 Create New Project"
3. **Select AI agents**: Choose which AIs to collaborate (e.g., GPT-4 for reasoning, Llama-3 for creativity)
4. **Define goals**: Describe what you want to accomplish
5. **Start collaborating**: Send messages and watch multiple AIs work together

### Example Workflow

```
User: "Help me design a web application for task management"

🤖 GPT-4 (General Assistant):
"I'll analyze the requirements and create a comprehensive plan..."

🤖 Llama-3 (Creative Writer):
"Let me suggest some creative UI/UX concepts and user experience flows..."

🤖 GPT-3.5 (Code Assistant):
"Here's the technical architecture and code structure..."

🤖 DeepSeek (Research Assistant):
"I've researched similar applications and best practices..."

🤝 Collaborative Synthesis:
"Based on all our perspectives, here's a complete solution..."
```

### Project Management

- **View projects**: Click "📋 My Projects" to see all your collaborations
- **Continue work**: Resume any project to maintain context
- **Track progress**: Monitor task completion and milestones
- **Export results**: Save collaborative outputs for later use

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Main Bot (`main.py`)**
   - Telegram bot interface
   - User interaction handling
   - Webhook management

2. **Project Manager (`project_manager.py`)**
   - Project creation and management
   - Persistent storage (JSON files)
   - Task and milestone tracking

3. **AI Collaboration Engine (`ai_collaboration.py`)**
   - Multi-agent coordination
   - Task dependency management
   - Response synthesis

### AI Agents

| Agent | Role | Specialization |
|-------|------|----------------|
| GPT-4 | General Assistant | Advanced reasoning, problem-solving |
| GPT-3.5 | Code Assistant | Fast code generation, debugging |
| Llama-3 | Creative Writer | Creative content, storytelling |
| DeepSeek | Research Assistant | Research, analysis, data processing |
| xAI | Specialist | Domain expertise, specialized tasks |

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adding New AI Agents

1. **Add API key** to environment variables
2. **Update `initialize_ai_agents()`** in `main.py`:
   ```python
   ai_agents["new_agent"] = AIAgent(
       name="New AI",
       engine="new_engine",
       role="New Role",
       description="What this AI specializes in",
       api_key=NEW_API_KEY,
       model="model-name",
       temperature=0.7
   )
   ```

### Custom Collaboration Patterns

Modify `ai_collaboration.py` to create custom workflows:

```python
# Example: Sequential collaboration
async def sequential_collaboration(project_id: str, user_request: str):
    # Agent 1 analyzes
    # Agent 2 builds on Agent 1's analysis
    # Agent 3 synthesizes final result
    pass
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

### Collaboration Statistics
- Total contributions per agent
- Average confidence scores
- Collaboration duration
- Task completion rates

### Project Metrics
- Active projects count
- Messages per project
- AI agent utilization
- User engagement patterns

## 🔒 Security and Privacy

- **API key protection**: Keys are stored as environment variables
- **User isolation**: Projects are user-specific
- **Data persistence**: Local JSON storage (can be upgraded to database)
- **Webhook security**: HTTPS required for production

## 🚀 Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python main.py
```

### Production Deployment
1. **Set up webhook URL** with HTTPS
2. **Configure environment variables**
3. **Use process manager** (PM2, systemd)
4. **Set up monitoring** and logging

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```
